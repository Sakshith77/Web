        <div class="caption"><b><mark><i>The divine birth of Lord Krishna in Mathura.</i></mark></b><br>
<p>The Birth of <a href="https://www.omspiritualshop.com/collections/pendent/products/krishna-dollar">Lord Krishna</a> is one of the most celebrated and cherished events in Hindu mythology. Born in the place Mathura, northern India around 3228 BCE, Lord Krishna’s life signifies the end of the Dvapara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali Yuga (which is considered the current age). He is the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, who descended to Earth to restore dharma (righteousness) and vanquish evil.  </p>
<h3><span style="color: #d61a1a;"><strong>Birth of Lord Krishna </strong></span></h3>
<p>The story of Lord Krishna's birth unfolds in the ancient kingdom of Mathura, ruled by the oppressive King Kamsa. Kamsa, the son of King Ugrasena, was notorious for his cruelty and biased rule. Unable to bear the injustice inflicted upon Mother Earth, Lord Brahma prayed to the Supreme God, Lord Vishnu, requesting his reincarnation to relieve the world from the evil ruler. Lord Vishnu accepted the plea and assured that he would defeat the tyrannical forces. </p>
<p>Kamsa had a sister, Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. Kamsa was gripped by fear when a prophecy foretold that he would be killed by Devaki's eighth child. In his paranoia, Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva, in a dark cell and mercilessly killed their first seven children. </p>
<p>The prophecy, delivered by a celestial voice, declared that Devaki's eighth child would bring an end to Kamsa's reign of terror. Despite their dire situation, Devaki and Vasudeva prayed fervently for the protection of their divine child. </p>
<p>One fateful night, during the auspicious month of Shravana (July-August), when the stars aligned perfectly, Devaki gave birth to her eighth child—Lord Krishna. In a miraculous turn of events, the prison doors swung open, and the chains or restraints holding Vasudeva were miraculously removed. Guided by divine intervention, Vasudeva carried the newborn Krishna in a basket and crossed the Yamuna River, which miraculously parted to allow him safe passage. </p>
<div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="Birth of Lord Krishna: Vasudeva carrying lord krishna" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/5285/9819/files/98_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723876939"></div>
<h3><span style="color: #da1a1a;"><strong>The Transfer to Gokul </strong></span></h3>
<p>Vasudeva transported the infant Krishna to the house of Nanda and Yashoda in Gokul, who had just been blessed with a baby girl. Vasudeva decided to swap the babies. He placed baby Krishna in the cradle of Nanda and Yashoda and gently took their daughter back to the prison in Mathura. When Kamsa heard that Devaki had given birth to her eighth child, he found only the baby girl, who was none other than the goddess Yogamaya. She escaped from his clutches and warned him that his death was still certain, as the child destined to kill him was already safe. This left Kamsa bewildered and fearful.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #d21a1a;"><strong>Krishna’s life in Gokul </strong></span></h3>
<div style="text-align: start;"><img style="float: none;" alt="Lord krishna life in Gokul" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/5285/9819/files/krishnan_1024x1024.jpg?v=1723877006"></div>
<p>Krishna was safe in Gokul, where he would grow up under the loving care of Nanda and Yashoda, away from the dangers of Mathura. His upbringing in Gokul was marked by divine leelas (playful exploits). Raised by Nanda and Yashoda, Krishna displayed miraculous powers from a young age. He performed various wonders, such as lifting the Govardhan Hill to protect the villagers from torrential rains, defeating the serpent Kaliya, and vanquishing many demons sent by Kamsa. </p>
<h3><span style="color: #d41a1a;"><strong>The Significance of Krishna’s Birth </strong></span></h3>
<p>Lord Krishna’s birth is celebrated annually on Janmashtami, the eighth day of the dark fortnight in the month of Shravana. It is a time of joy and devotion for millions of Hindus worldwide. The story of Krishna’s birth symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and the divine intervention to restore cosmic order. </p>
<p>Lord Krishna is prominently referenced in several Hindu mythological texts, particularly in the epic Mahabharata. He is also a central figure in the Bhagavata Purana, a significant Hindu scripture dating back to the 10th century BCE. In this text, Lord Krishna is depicted as the charioteer of the warrior Arjuna, providing him with moral guidance and strategic military advice. His birth marks the beginning of a divine narrative that emphasizes the importance of righteousness, devotion, and the power of divine grace.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #d11c1c;"><strong> Conclusion</strong></span></h3>
<p>The birth story of Lord Krishna is a timeless tale of divine intervention and the victory of righteousness over malevolence. As we celebrate Janmashtami and reflect on Krishna’s divine birth, we are reminded of the eternal truth that loves, righteousness, and devotion are the path to spiritual fulfillment

        <div class="caption"><b><mark><i>Krishna's playful childhood in Gokul, stealing butter and charming hearts.</i></mark></b><br>
        <p><strong>Krishna&#8217;s Childhood Antics</strong></p>
<p>Krishna&#8217;s pastimes of crawling about and drinking His mother&#8217;s breast milk gradually stopped. Soon, He walked on His lotus feet and began stealing butter. Is there anyone who did not feel unlimited bliss when the Lord, who is the very source of bliss, enacted His childhood pastimes?</p>
<p>One day, when no one was looking, Krishna began His mischief of stealing fresh butter. Startled upon seeing His own reflection in a jeweled pillar, He shivered in fear and said, &#8220;O dear brother, do not tell Mother. I will save some butter for You, and You may enjoy it too.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mother Yasoda&#8217;s Observation</strong></p>
<p>Watching her mischievous son from a hidden place, Mother Yasoda heard these sweet broken words with great relish. Then she innocently appeared before Krishna and Balarama. Pointing to His effulgent reflection, Krishna said, &#8220;O Ma! Being very greedy, this boy came here today in order to steal your butter. Although I forbade Him, He did not listen to Me. And when I got angry with Him, He also got angry. But I am not at all greedy for butter.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna&#8217;s Clever Excuses</strong></p>
<p>One day, while Yasoda was outside the house engaged in some domestic activities, Krishna stole butter again. When Yasoda returned and called out, &#8220;O my darling Krishna! Where are You and what are You doing?&#8221; Hearing her, Krishna became afraid and stopped stealing butter. Pausing for a moment, He answered, &#8220;Mother! My hand started burning from the shining effulgence of My ruby bangles, so I stuck it in this butter pot to relieve the pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pleased by her son&#8217;s clever words, Yasoda said, &#8220;Hey Vatsa! Please come sit on my lap. Oh my darling, show me the burns on Your hand.&#8221; Then Yasoda kissed Krishna&#8217;s hand and consoled Him, saying, &#8220;Ahh&#8230;ahh&#8230; Look, Your hand has been burned. So let me remove these ruby bangles.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More Mischief</strong></p>
<p>On another day, Krishna cried and rubbed His eyes with His flower bud-like palms. In a choked voice, He uttered unintelligible phrases. Even though Yasoda had previously scolded Krishna for stealing butter, this time she wiped the tears from His eyes with the edge of her sari. While tenderly caressing Krishna, she said, &#8220;Hey Lala, all of our stock of butter actually belongs to You alone.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Moon&#8217;s Mystery</strong></p>
<p>One night, the soothing rays of the full moon illumined the courtyard of Nanda&#8217;s house. Yasoda sat there talking with some elderly gopis while Krishna played nearby, gazing at the moon. Sneaking up behind Yasoda, Krishna removed the veil covering her head, loosened her braid, and patted her on the back to get her attention with His butter-soft lotus palms. His voice choked up as He continually cried. Yasoda&#8217;s heart swelled with maternal love, so she indicated with a glance that her friends should attend to Krishna.</p>
<p>With great respect and affection, the gopis enthusiastically lifted up Krishna and asked, &#8220;O darling! What do You want? Do You want some khira?&#8221; Krishna replied, &#8220;No, No!&#8221; &#8220;Do You want some thick creamy yogurt?&#8221; Krishna replied, &#8220;No, No!&#8221; &#8220;Do you want some cheese?&#8221; Again, Krishna said, &#8220;No, no! I want freshly churned condensed butter.&#8221; The gopis continued, &#8220;Do not lament or be angry with Your mother. What do You mean by &#8216;condensed butter?'&#8221; Pointing His little index finger to the full moon, Krishna replied, &#8220;I want that freshly churned condensed butter!&#8221;</p>
<p>The elderly gopis said, &#8220;O Vatsa! Do not mistake the moon for a huge piece of butter. It is a rajahamsa (royal swan) gliding across the lake of the sky.&#8221; Krishna said, &#8220;Then give Me that rajahamsa so I can play with him. Quickly catch him before he reaches the bank of the lake.&#8221; Full of anxiety, Krishna kicked His legs and cried loudly, &#8220;Give Me! Give Me!&#8221; While Krishna showed His childish antics, some other gopis said, &#8220;O darling! They have lied to You. What You see is not a rajahamsa, but it is the moon hanging in the sky and it is called Candra.&#8221; Krishna said, &#8220;Then give Me that Candra! I really want it so I can play with it. Right now! Get it!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Yasoda&#8217;s Gentle Wisdom</strong></p>
<p>Yasoda placed her crying son on her lap and comforted Him, &#8220;Darling! Actually, it is freshly churned condensed butter! Definitely, it is not a rajahamsa nor is it the moon. Regardless, I can never give it to You. Just see, by chance or by the arrangement of Providence, it has poisonous spots on it. Although it looks very tasty, no one in this world can eat it.&#8221; Then Krishna said, &#8220;Mother, mother! Why is it stained with spots of poison? What is poison anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing a change in Krishna&#8217;s mood, Mother Yasoda embraced Him and spoke in a gentle, sweet voice. &#8220;Listen attentively, my dearest son. There is an ocean of milk called Ksira-sagara.&#8221; Krishna: &#8220;Mother, please tell Me about that? How many milk cows made that ocean?&#8221; Yasoda: &#8220;Darling, the milk ocean was not made by cows.&#8221; Krishna: &#8220;Mother, you are lying to Me. How can there be milk without cows?&#8221; Yasoda: &#8220;The one who gave cows the ability to produce milk can also make milk even without cows.&#8221; Krishna: &#8220;Who is He?&#8221; Yasoda: &#8220;He is the Lord, the cause of creation. He is Bhagavan. He is immovable and all-pervading. Although He is everywhere, I cannot show Him to You.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krishna: &#8220;Well, mother, are you telling Me the truth?&#8221; Yasoda: &#8220;Long ago, the demigods and the demons had a fight. To favor the demigods and bewilder the demons, the Lord churned the ocean of milk. Mandara Mountain served as the churning rod and Vasuki, the king of the serpents, offered his body for the rope. The demons and demigods stood on opposite sides pulling that rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krishna: &#8220;Mother, did they churn the way the gopis do?&#8221; Yasoda: &#8220;Yes, my son. The churning of the Ksira-sagara produced a poison named kalakuta.&#8221; Krishna: &#8220;Mother, how did churning milk produce poison? Only snakes have poison.&#8221; Yasoda: &#8220;Darling, Mahadeva drank that poison. But the snakes drank the drops of poison that fell from his mouth. As a result, they now have poison. The poison rising from that milk is also the energy of the Lord.&#8221; Krishna: &#8220;Yes, mother, that is indeed true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yasoda: &#8220;Darling, this condensed butter You are seeing in the sky is produced from that Ksira-sagara. That is why the moon is spotted with the remnants of that poison. Look carefully, do You see it? Therefore, do not try to eat that butter, but please take my freshly churned butter instead.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna&#8217;s Sleep</strong></p>
<p>After hearing this description, Krishna felt sleepy, so Mother Yasoda put Him to rest in an opulent golden bed on a fluffy soft mattress, whiter than powdered camphor.</p>
<p><strong>Morning Delights</strong></p>
<p>The next morning, Yasoda brought butter, yogurt, and other eatables into Krishna&#8217;s room. Lovingly fondling His body, she said, &#8220;Wake up! God forbid, You seem to be weak from not eating sufficiently yesterday.&#8221; After Krishna awoke, Yasoda cleansed His mouth with scented water. Then she offered Him a golden plate full of butter, yogurt, and other delights while saying, &#8220;O my beloved son, take whatever You like.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna&#8217;s Innocence</strong></p>
<p>Krishna replied, &#8220;Mother, I will not eat anything that you have brought Me. Last night you lied to Me and put Me to sleep. And I felt very distressed due to hunger.&#8221; Yasoda said, &#8220;Krishna, if You went to sleep then who stole the butter?&#8221; Krishna replied, &#8220;Mother, when did I steal your butter? You are lying.&#8221; With His charming transcendental pastimes, Krishna continually captivated the heart of Mother Yasoda.</p>
<p><strong>More Mischief and Parental Love</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes while roaming in the courtyard, Krishna caught a stray calf, put it on His lap, and kissed it with His lotus mouth. Seeing this, Yasoda felt both pleased and apprehensive. In the pasturing ground, Krishna sometimes grabbed the tail of a calf. Startled, the calf would jump up and run away, dragging Krishna, dressed only by the wind, behind him. Thus, the uncovered Brahman personified stole the hearts of the Vrajavasis.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Krishna smeared cow dung all over Himself. Seeing it as musk covering His body, the Vrajavasis enjoyed a festival of beauty. How can there be any inebriety in the one who is beauty personified? At other times, Yasoda tied a very attractive turban on Krishna&#8217;s head, and dressed Him in gorgeous yellow garments. After marking His body with tilaka the color of gorocana, she would anoint His lotus eyes with soft kajala. Adopting the mood of an ordinary mother, Yasoda placed her saliva on Krishna&#8217;s forehead to prevent people from casting an evil eye on her son, whose sublime elegance enchants the entire creation.</p>
<p><strong>Adorned with Love</strong></p>
<p>While playing in the courtyards of the gopis, Krishna often wore a necklace of tiger nails set in gold and a waist belt bedecked with costly jewels. Once the Vraja gopis talked amongst themselves, &#8220;Krishna brings good fortune wherever He goes, and His presence makes everyone&#8217;s life glorious. Who in this world is not enchanted by the frivolous and amusing childhood pastimes of Krishna? Who cannot appreciate these mirthful activities?&#8221; Rather than getting upset, they felt the greatest happiness whenever Krishna broke their clay pots and stole their butter. Still, the housewives of Vrndavana pretended to be angry and complained to Yasoda about Krishna&#8217;s stealing.</p>
<p><strong>Gopis&#8217; Mixed Feelings</strong></p>
<p>In a mixed mood of love and laughter, the gopis warned Yasoda, &#8220;O Queen of Vrndavana, Yasoda! In the future, you will suffer for the mischievous acts of your son. Although now your son is like a young sprout with tender leaves, already He is disrupting the whole creation. But be careful, in the future, when this tender sprout grows into a tree full of leaves and branches, He will bring you tremendous pain. Now your boy&#8217;s adventures are just beginning, but by nature, they are forever expanding. Your son&#8217;s naughty behavior will soon destroy our whole village. We have no idea what mischief He will do next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before our cows have been milked, your son unties the calves and lets them drink all the milk. If someone tries to rebuke Him, He simply smiles sweetly, and that person immediately forgets all his anger. If we keep our butter in a dark storeroom, He uses His natural effulgence to easily find our stock and steal it. But instead of eating it Himself, He takes great pleasure in feeding it to the monkeys. When the monkeys reach their fill and refuse to eat more, Krishna breaks the pot and throws the butter on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Gopis&#8217; Complaints</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He catches the butter pots which are beyond His reach by stacking many small tables on top of each other, climbing them, and extending His arm to grab the pots. Krishna is always stealing our butter and yogurt. If someone tries to stop Him, He immediately drops the food on the ground and quickly escapes. If by chance a housewife captures Him, Krishna twists her wrist and runs away. Then from a safe distance, He yells back, &#8216;Hey just stay where you are! If you come any closer, I will give you even more trouble by teasing your babies and making them cry.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone calls, &#8216;Hey thief, stop!&#8217; Krishna becomes angry and shouts, &#8216;You are the thief. This house is Mine and everything in this house belongs to Me.&#8217; In the morning we spread a fresh layer of clay on the outer walls of our houses, and paint beautiful designs on top of it with powdered limestone. Then your son Krishna comes along to spoil everything by throwing dirt all over our houses. In front of you, Krishna is so quiet and well behaved. But when He enters our homes, He acts frivolously, steals our food, speaks sharp words, and becomes angry and greedy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Gopis&#8217; Love and Laughter</strong></p>
<p>In this way, the ladies of Vrndavana, pretending to be angry, made many complaints against Krishna. But in reality, Krishna&#8217;s joyous pranks filled everyone with pleasure. When accused by the gopis, Krishna feigned innocence and shed false tears. Though culpable for His immoral acts of stealing and offending the villagers in various ways, Krishna tried to minimize His misdeeds by speaking very sweetly.</p>
<p><strong>Krishna&#8217;s Defense</strong></p>
<p>Responding to the charges of the gopis, Krishna said, &#8220;Mother, none of these ladies have any affection in their hearts. They are not speaking a single word of truth. Actually, they are all liars, and have given up their human dignity. Whenever I see them or their sons I feel completely happy. Because of the natural affection I have for them, I regularly visit their homes every morning at sunrise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma, so knowing My motives you can easily understand they are deliberately telling lies. You should not believe them at all. Mother, since you are My worshipable superior, from now on I will not visit My friends anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Yasoda&#8217;s Affection</strong></p>
<p>Saying this, Krishna sobbed and cried. Vrajesvari Yasoda put Krishna on her lap and smiled shyly at the gopis in order to conceal her real mood. Then just to please Krishna, Yasoda said, &#8220;You gopis are all telling lies. Only Krishna is telling the truth. He is just an innocent boy, so how could He possibly do such things. I think you have already scolded my son sufficiently.&#8221; After saying this, Yasoda spoke affectionately with the gopis. Then as a friendly gesture, Rohini applied tilaka to their foreheads and sent them home.</p>
<p><strong>Nanda&#8217;s Arrival</strong></p>
<p>After the departure of the gopis, Yasoda, who is expert in the laws of etiquette, spoke to Krishna, &#8220;My son, because of greed You performed many improper acts in the homes of our friends. Although in Your own home such behavior is acceptable, in the home of another it is totally unbecoming. O beautiful one! These deeds of Yours were not good at all. From now on just stay here and play.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Parental Love</strong></p>
<p>After instructing her son, Yasoda caressed Him lovingly. Just then, Vrajaraja Nanda arrived and brightened the room with his favorable feelings. Nanda spoke pleasing words to encourage and pacify his charming son. &#8220;O Vatsa! Come sit on my lap.&#8221; Leaving Yasoda&#8217;s lap, Krishna climbed up on Nanda&#8217;s lap and wrapped His arm around His father&#8217;s neck. Then Krishna said softly, &#8220;Why is mother chastising Me for nothing?&#8221; Nanda responded, &#8220;What is this all about?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Krishna&#8217;s Innocence</strong></p>
<p>That fabulous boy of oceanic intelligence replied, &#8220;Mother, now tell truthfully what happened.&#8221; Then mother Yasoda recounted the misdeeds of Krishna by repeating the words uttered by the gopis. Pointing to Queen Yasoda, Vrajaraja Nanda said, &#8220;My son is faultless. He has not done anything wrong. I always see Him behaving nicely. By siding with those who made fun of Him and with those who showed envy toward my jewel-like son, you have wrongly accused my well-behaved son, and so you should be punished.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nanda&#8217;s Amusement</strong></p>
<p>Concealing his real mood behind these words, Nanda rebuked Yasoda and comforted his son: &#8220;O my darling son, just stay in my lap and do not go to anyone else.&#8221; Though hearing His father&#8217;s words, Krishna immediately jumped off his lap just like an unpredictable child, and quickly climbed on Yasoda&#8217;s lap. Seeing this gave both parents a hearty laugh.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Moral of the Story</strong></p>
<p>Krishna&#8217;s childhood pastimes reveal the sweetness and innocence of the divine. His interactions with His parents, friends, and the gopis highlight the pure, loving relationships that transcend the mundane. These pastimes remind us of the importance of love, trust, and the joy of simple pleasures in life.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<p><em>O Lord Krishna, may we always remember Your sweet and playful pastimes. Help us to cultivate pure love and devotion in our hearts, and to find joy in the simple moments of life. May we always seek Your presence and cherish the relationships we have with our loved ones.</em></p>

        <div class="caption"><b><mark><i>Krishna subdues the serpent Kaliya in the Yamuna river.</i></mark></b><br>
       
In the enchanting realms of Vrindavan, where the emerald waters of Yamuna gracefully weave through the sacred land, the divine avatar of Lord Vishnu, Krishna, manifested with skin resembling monsoon clouds and eyes that sparkled like profound pools of wisdom. Amidst the laughter and vibrant life along the riverbanks of Mathura, Krishna, often seen frolicking with the cowherd children, concealed a secret deeper than the Yamuna’s sacred waters.A long time ago, in the kingdom of Vrishni, there was a ruler named Kansa, who was the brother of Mata Devaki. Devaki married Vasudeva, the son of Yadava king Shurasena, in the capital city of Mathura. However, an oracle predicted that Devaki and Vasudeva’s 8th son would be the end of Kansa.Fearing this prophecy, Kansa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudeva and cruelly killed their first seven children. When it was time for the eighth child, a divine intervention occurred. Lord Vishnu appeared in Vasudeva’s dream and instructed him to take the baby to Gokula and give it to Nand, Vasudeva’s cousin. In a brave move, Vasudeva placed baby Krishna in a basket and left for Gokula during a stormy night. To reach Gokula, he had to cross the flooded Yamuna river. Upon entering the river, the water level rose, but miraculously, when Krishna’s feet touched the water, the river calmed down. Vasudeva successfully reached Gokula, met Nand Maharaj, handed over Lord Krishna, and took Nand’s daughter back to Mathura. That’s how Lord Krishna ended up in Vrindavan. In Vrindavan, he grew up with Nand Maharaj as his foster father, playing joyfully with friends and taking care of cows. The tales of Krishna’s playful childhood, especially with Radha and his friends, became legendary in Vrindavan. And thus, the divine journey of Lord Krishna in the enchanting land of Vrindavan began.In the picturesque land of Vrindavan, where the river Yamuna flowed peacefully, a fearsome serpent named Kaliya naag had made its dwelling. This venomous serpent had poisoned the waters and spread terror among the residents of Vrindavan. Kaliya’s residence is on the island of Ramaṇaka but with the fear of Gruda he leaves his home and comes to Vrindavan as it is the only place where he can save himself from Garuda. <br/><br/>Kaliya’s poison is so dangerous that birds who are flying over Yamuna are dying, animals who drank Yamuna’s water are dead. <br/><br/>One day, as Lord Krishna was playing with his cowherd friends, their ball accidentally fell into the river. Without hesitation, Lord Krishna plunged into the waters to retrieve it. Upon entering the river, Kaliya naag got angry and emerged with its multiple hoods, creating a terrifying spectacle. The serpent coiled around Krishna, trapping him in its powerful grip.<br/><br/>Witnessing this, the residents of Vrindavan, including Krishna’s friends and family, were overcome with fear. However, Krishna, with his divine strength and purpose, expanded his size, causing Kaliya’s grip to loosen. <br/><br/>Undeterred, Kaliya tightened its coils even more, but Lord Krishna retaliated and started dancing on the serpent’s many hoods with unmatched grace and agility.<br/>As soon as Krishna danced on the hoods of Kaliya, the black, flowing locks around his beautiful moon-like face flew in all directions. The black ankle bells on his feet and the bells tied to his waist created sweet and divine melodies that enchanted everyone. The gods showered flowers from the sky in appreciation. Kaliya naag lifted his hoods, and Krishna, with his small, red lotus feet, crushed them underneath.As Krishna danced, Kaliya surrendered to the divine power. All the venom from Kaliya’s mouth came out, and in the end, exhausted, Kaliya fainted.  Understanding the significance of the moment, Kaliya’s wives approached Krishna, seeking mercy for their husband and tell lord krishna how with the fear of Garuda they came to Vrindavan.  When he regained consciousness, Kaliya realized the greatness of the Lord and prayed for protection along with his wives.<br/><br/>In a compassionate gesture, Krishna chose not to harm Kaliya, but instead, he expelled the serpent from the Yamuna, cleansing its waters. In order to protect Kaliya from Garuda, Lord Krishna imprinted his divine footprints on Kaliya’s head.<br/><br/>Kaliya understood that the touch of the Lord’s feet had bestowed double blessings upon him. His wives, through a beautiful hymn, </div><div>मस्तुभ्यम भगवते पुरुषाय महात्मने…नमः कृष्णाय रामाय वासुदेवसुताय च प्रद्युम्नाय अनिरुद्धाय सात्वतम पथये नमः<br/><br/>Afterward, Lord Krishna instructed Kaliya naag, his wives, children, and relatives to leave the river and go towards the ocean. The Lord promised that the Garuda, whom Kaliya feared, would not trouble him in the future because the imprints of the Lord’s feet were on his hoods. Yamuna regained her ancient glory, and her water became like nectar for everyone to drink.<br/><br/>This tale is mentioned in the 16th chapter of Bhagavata Purana. The tale of Krishna subduing Kaliya became a symbol of good triumphing over evil and the importance of humility in the face of divine power. Following this incident, Krishna earned the name <a>Kaliya Nartana Krishna</a>,” and this particular moment became one of the most widely portrayed scenes in Indian art.The divine dance on Kaliya’s hoods not only showcased Lord Krishna’s Divinity but also conveyed a timeless message of righteousness prevailing over darkness. The purified Yamuna, now free from Kaliya’s influence, flowed serenely through the sacred land of Vrindavan, marking another chapter in the enchanting journey of Lord Krishna.<br/><br/>According to legend, Lord Krishna instructed Kaliya not to look back towards Vrindavan and the Yamuna, warning that he would turn into stone if he did so. However, in a village now recognized as Jait, situated 20 km away from Mathura, Kaliya looked back and transformed into a stone. In Jait, there is a temple where a stone statue of Kaliya Naag can be seen.</div>

        <div class="caption"><b><mark><i>Krishna lifts Govardhan Hill to protect villagers from Indra's wrath.</i></mark></b><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">There is an interesting story in the Bhagwata and other Puranas about Shri Krishna lifting the ‘Govardhan Parvat’ or Govardhan Hill when he was only a small child. The story goes like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once, when the elder people of Braj including Nanda Maharaj were planning for the Puja of Lord Indra, Shri Krishna, a child then, questioned them as to why they were doing so. Nanda Maharaj explained to Krishna that this was done every year to please Lord Indra so that he continued to grace the people of Braj by providing rain as and when required. But little Krishna debated that they were farmers and they should only do their duty or ‘Karma’ to the best of their abilities, by concentrating on farming and protecting their cattle, rather than performing pujas or conduct sacrifices like this for any natural phenomenon. Finally convinced by Krishna, the villagers did not perform with the puja.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furious with the inhabitants of Braj for listening to the little child Krishna and worshipping the Govardhan Hill instead of him, lndra, the King of Heaven, decided to punish them by sending terrible rain clouds to flood the land of Vrindavan. Calling the Samavartaka clouds of devastation, lndra ordered them to lash upon Vrindavan with torrents of rain and thunderstorms and cause extensive floods that would destroy the livelihood of the inhabitants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As terrible rains and thunderstorms ravaged the land and submerged it under water, the frightened and helpless inhabitants of Vrindavan approached Lord Krishna for help. Krishna, who understood the situation perfectly well, lifted up the entire Govardhan Hill at once with His left hand, and held it up like an umbrella. One by one all the inhabitants of Vrindavan, along with their cows and other household possessions, took shelter under Govardhan Hill. For seven days they stayed under the hill, safe from the terrible rains and surprisingly undisturbed by hunger or thirst. They were also astounded to see the huge Govardhan Hill resting perfectly balanced on Krishna’s little finger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stunned and mystified with the order of events, King Indra called back the clouds of devastation, thus stopping the thunderstorms and the rains. The sky became clear again and the sun shone brightly over Vrindavan. Little Krishna asked the inhabitants to return home without any fear, and gently placed the Govardhan Hill back to exactly where it was. All the inhabitants of Braj including Nanda Maharaj, Yasoda and Balarama hailed Krishna and embraced Him with happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was how the false pride of King Indra was shattered to pieces. He came to Lord Krishna with folded hands and prayed to Him for forgiveness. Shri Krishna, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, bestowed his grace on Indra and also enlightened him about his ‘Dharma’ and duties.</p>

             <p>The Bhagavad Gita, or the song of God, was revealed by Lord Shree Krishna to Arjun on the threshold of the epic war of Mahabharata. A decisive battle between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, was just about to commence on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. A detailed account of the reasons that led to such a colossal war; is given under Introduction-The Setting of the Bhagavad Gita.</p><p>The Bhagavad Gita is primarily a conversation between Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun. However, the first chapter begins with a dialogue between King Dhritarashtra and his minister Sanjay. Dhritarashtra being blind, could not leave his palace in Hastinapur but was eager to know the ongoings of the battlefield.</p><p>Sanjay was a disciple of Sage Ved Vyas, the author of the epic Mahabharata and several other Hindu scriptures. Sage Ved Vyas possessed a mystic ability to see and hear events occurring in distant places. He had bestowed upon Sanjay the miraculous power of distant vision. Therefore, Sanjay could see and hear, what transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra, and gave a first-hand account to King Dhritarashtra while still being in his palace.</p>
